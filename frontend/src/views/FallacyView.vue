      <p>Do you ever feel like you know the other side is wrong... but you can’t explain why?</p>
      <p>Chances are, the other person is using a logical fallacy!</p>
      <p>Wait… what’s a logical fallacy?</p>
      <p>A logical fallacy is:</p>
      <div class="definition">
        <p>A shortcut that <i>sounds</i> smart, but doesn’t really make sense when you look closely.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>Its purpose is only to win the argument, and not to follow logic. It’s adding, taking away, or mixing things to make the listener confused so that they can’t refute.</p>

      <h2>Should We Be Aware Of Logical Fallacies?</h2>
      <p>Yes! Absolutely</p>
      <p>Here is a few points on how everyone will benefit from knowing what logical fallacies are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>We think better!</b> <br><span>Our brains get better and better at analysing and understanding. </span></li>
        <li><b> We spot when someone is twisting the truth.</b> <br><span>We don't just fall for arguments that sound smart - we know when they’re not playing fair.</span></li>
        <li><b>We make smarter decisions.</b> <br><span>From voting to buying things - understanding fallacies helps us choose based on facts, not tricks.</span></li>
        <li><b>We become better at explaining ourselves</b> <br><span>When we avoid fallacies, our own arguments become clearer and more convincing.</span></li>
        <li><b>We handle disagreements more calmly</b> <br><span>It’s easier to stay cool when we understand the tricks that make debates feel unfair or frustrating.</span></li>
        <li><b>We protect ourselves from being misled</b> <br><span>Whether it’s an ad, a speech, or a viral post - we’re less likely to get fooled.</span></li>
